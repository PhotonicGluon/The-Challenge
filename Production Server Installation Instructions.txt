                                        SETTING UP THE PRODUCTION SERVER
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Open a console/terminal.

2.  Create the folder `FOLDER_PATH` to place all the server things in using the following command:
        ```
        mkdir FOLDER_PATH
        cd FOLDER_PATH
        ```

3.  Create a virtual environment using the following command:
        ```
        python3 -m venv venv --prompt NAME_OF_VENV
        ```

4.  Activate the environment by running:
        ```
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    you are now inside the virtual environment.

5.  Update pip by running the following command:
        ```
        python -m pip install -U pip
        ```

6.  Obtain the latest "wheel" file of "The Challenge", `WHEEL_FILE`, and place it in `FOLDER_PATH`. It should have a name
    which satisfies the following format:
        "The_Challenge-[VERSION]-py3-none-any.whl"

7.  Install "The Challenge" by running:
        ```
        pip install WHEEL_FILE -U
        ```
    Check that the installation was successful by executing the following command:
        ```
        python3 -c "import the_challenge;print('Successful')"
        ```
    If the last output was 'Successful' it was installed successfully; if not it was not installed successfully.

8.  Install "OpenSSL".
        - How to install it is dependent on the system.

9.  Install uWSGI with WebSocket support using the following command:
        ```
        CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib" UWSGI_PROFILE_OVERRIDE=ssl=true pip install uwsgi -Iv --no-binary :all:
        ```

10. Run the following commands:
        ```
        cd venv/var
        mkdir "the_challenge-instance"
        cd "the_challenge-instance"
        secretKey=$(python -c 'import secrets;print(bytes(str(secrets.token_bytes(32)), "utf-8")[2:-1])')
        printf "\"\"\"\nconfig.py\n\nDescription: The configuration for this particular instance.\n\"\"\"\n\nSECRET_KEY = $secretKey" > config.py
        ```
    This is what the above commands did:
        a. Created an instance folder ("the_challenge-instance")
        b. Created a configuration file that is unique to your instance.
        c. Created a pseudorandom secret key for the instance.

11. Navigate back to the root directory by running this command:
        ```
        cd ../../..
        ```
12. Start the uWSGI server using the following commands:
    ```
    export PRODUCTION_SERVER_PORT=PORT_NUMBER
    uwsgi --http :$PRODUCTION_SERVER_PORT --gevent 1000 --http-websockets --master --module "the_challenge:app"
    ```
