                There will be 14 questions in <strong>The Challenge</strong>. This means that you will have an average
                of approximately 64.3 seconds to solve each question in the 15 minutes (900 seconds) given to you. All
                four movements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_Gynt_(Grieg)#Suite_No._1,_Op._46"
                                     target="_blank">Edvard Grieg's Peer Gynt Suite No. 1, Op. 46</a> will be played
                during this time.
                <br><br>
                However, expect that the questions' difficulty to increase as you progress.
                <br><br>
                The following are the 14 questions' testing points:
            </p>

                    <li><strong>Do not reload the page when playing The Challenge.</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>All answers are to be typed in the MathLex language, as specified
                        <a href="http://mathlex.org/doc/language" target="_blank">here</a>.</strong> The following are
                        several important pointers when entering your answer:
                        <ul>
                            <li>To enter a number like "one million, two hundred and thirty-four thousand, five hundred
                                and sixty-seven" do not enter any commas/periods (e.g.<code>1,234,567</code> or
                                <code>1.234.567</code>). Instead, put all the digits of the number together
                                (<code>1234567</code>).
                            </li>
                            <li>To enter $ax$ you will need to enter the string <code>a*x</code> into the input
                                field.
                            </li>
                            <li>To enter a fraction like $\frac pq$ you will need to enter the string <code>p/q</code>
                                into the input field.
                            </li>
                            <li>To enter $\sqrt{ax+b}$ you will need to enter the string <code>sqrt(a*x+b)</code> into
                                the input field.
                            </li>
                            <li>To enter $\sec^2 \left(ax+b\right)$ you will need to enter the string
                                <code>(sec(a*x+b)**2)</code> or <code>(sec(a*x+b)^2)</code> into the input field.

                        documents.</strong></li>
                    <li>Answers which are not exact are to be rounded to 3 decimal places. Round all values which
                        4<sup>th</sup> decimal place is more than or equal to 5 <strong>up</strong>. This means that
                        you should round <code>1.23456</code> to <code>1.235</code> and round <code>6.54321</code> to
                        <code>6.543</code>. <strong>Do not follow the

                                <strong>exact</strong> form. This includes the term which does not include an $x$ in it
                                (i.e. the term independent of $x$).
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Exception</strong>: For question 10 and question 12 all coefficients of $x$ are

                            <li>Four arithmetic operations ($+$, $-$, $\times$, $\div$) including the order of
                                operations and use of brackets/parentheses
                            </li>
                            <li>Fractional function which retains the fraction in the form $\frac pq$ where $p$ and $q$
                                are co-prime integers
                            </li>

                            <li>Able to handle computations such as $p^q$ where $p$ is a real number and $q$ is a

                        checked.
                        <ul>
                            <li>However, you are advised to prepare a blank sheet of A4 or US Letter paper for the rough
